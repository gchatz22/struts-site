# Fetch Metadata Interceptor

## Description

Interceptor that implements Cross-Origin Embedder Policy on incoming requests.

COEP prevents the document from loading any framed documents which don't opt-in by setting the COEP header. (`Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp`). This provides protection for documents that don't restrict framing. A document that doesn't set COEP cannot be framed by another document with COEP. All descendents of a document with COEP will also enforce the same restrictions.

COEP is now supported by all major browsers.

- `enforcingMode` - Boolean variable allowing the user to let COEP operate in `enforcing`, which blocks both resource and reports violation, or `report-only` mode, which only reports violation. Default value for field is `false`.
- `disabled` - Boolean variable disabling and enabling COEP. Default value for field is `false`.
